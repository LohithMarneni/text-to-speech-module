# Text-to-Speech Pronunciation Tool

## Project Overview

This project provides a simple text-to-speech (TTS) tool using Python. The tool converts a list of words or sentences into speech and plays the generated audio file. It leverages the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library to generate speech from text and uses the system's default media player to play the audio file.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Converts provided text into speech using the `gTTS` library.
- **Audio Playback**: Automatically plays the generated audio file using the systemâ€™s default media player.
